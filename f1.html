          <summary class="topicsa"><h1>Aerodynamics</h1></summary>
          <h2 class="topics2a">Aerodynamics</h2>
          <p class="define">The study about how the air flows around the f1 and how it affects the car its components and it performance. </p>
          
          <h2 class="topics2a">CAD</h2>
          <p class="define">A switch in the cockpit to alter the split of the car's braking power between the front and the rear wheels 
            <br>according to a driver's wishes.</p>
          
            <h2 class="topics2a">CFD</h2>
          <p class="define">Short for Computational fluid dynamics, a tool used by F1 designers that uses complex mathematics and simulation
            <br> to predict aerodynamic airflow. Normally used in conjunction with traditional wind tunnel research.</p>
          
            <h2 class="topics2a">Clean air</h2>
          <p class="define">Air that isn't turbulent, and thus offers optimum aerodynamic conditions, as experienced by a car at the head of the field.</p>
          
          <h2 class="topics2a">Coanda effect</h2>
          <p class="define">The tendency of a fluid jet, such as airflow, to be attracted to a nearby surface. F1 aerodynamicists use the effect to 
            <br>help divert airflow to specific areas of the car, for example from the exhaust exit to the rear diffuser. </p>
            <h2 class="topics2a">Downforce</h2>
          <p class="define">The aerodynamic force that is applied in a downwards direction as a car travels forwards. This is harnessed to improve a 
            <br>car's traction and its handling through corners.</p>
          
            <h2 class="topics2a">Drag</h2>
          <p class="define">The aerodynamic resistance experienced as a car travels forwards.</p>
          
            <h2 class="topics2a">DRS</h2>
          <p class="define">Also known as adjustable rear wings, DRS (Drag Reduction System) rear wings allow the driver to adjust the wing between two
            <br> pre-determined settings from the cockpit. The system's availability is electronically governed - it can be used at any time in practice
            <br> and qualifying (unless a driver is on wet-weather tyres), but during the race can only be activated when a driver is less than one 
            <br>second behind another car at pre-determined points on the track. The system is then deactivated once the driver brakes. In combination 
            <br>with KERS, it is designed to boost overtaking. Also like KERS, it isn't compulsory.</p>
            
          <h2 class="topics2a">Slipstreaming</h2>
          <p class="define">A driving tactic when a driver is able to catch the car ahead and duck in behind its rear wing to benefit from a reduction
            <br> in drag over its body and hopefully be able to achieve a superior maximum speed to slingshot past before the next corner.</p>
          
          <h2 class="topics2a">Turbulence</h2>
          <p class="define">The result of the disruption of airflow caused by an interruption to its passage, such as when it hits a rear wing and its
            <br> horizontal flow is spoiled. </p>
          
        </details>
        <details>

          <p class="define">Weights fixed around the car to maximise its balance and bring it up to the minimum weight limit.</p>
          <h2 class="topics2a">Bargeboard</h2>
          <p class="define">The consequence of a tyre, or part of a tyre, overheating. Excess heat can cause rubber to soften and break 
            <br>away in chunks from the body of the tyre. Blistering can be caused by the selection of an inappropriate tyre compound 
            <br>(for example, one that is too soft for circuit conditions), too high tyre pressure, or an improperly set up car. </p>
          <h2 class="topics2a">Bodywork</h2>
          <p class="define">The carbon fibre sections fitted onto the monocoque before the cars leave the pits, such as the engine

          <p class="define">The rear section of the car's floor or undertray where the air flowing under the car exits. The design of the 
            <br>diffuser is crucial as it controls the speed at which the air exits. The faster its exit, the lower the air pressure beneath 
            <br>the car, and hence the more downforce the car generates.</p>
          
            <h2 class="topics2a">Endplate</h2>
          <p class="define">The vertical panels that form the outer edges of a car's front and rear wings and to which the main wing 
            <br>elements are attached.</p>
          
            <h2 class="topics2a">Kevlar</h2>
          <p class="define">A synthetic fibre that is combined with epoxy resin to create a strong, lightweight composite used in F1 car

            <h2 class="topics2a">Plank</h2>
          <p class="define">A hard wooden strip (also known as a skid block) that is fitted front-to-back down the middle of the underside
            <br> of all cars to check that they are not being run too close to the track surface, something that is apparent if the wood is
            <br> excessively worn.</p>
          
            <h2 class="topics2a">Sidepod</h2>
          <p class="define">The part of the car that flanks the sides of the monocoque alongside the driver and runs back to the rear wing,
            <br> housing the radiators.</p>
          
            <h2 class="topics2a">Tub</h2>
          <p class="define">Another name for the chassis or monocoque, so called because of its shape.</p>

          <h2 class="topics2a">Drive-through penalty</h2>
          <p class="define">One of two penalties that can be handed out at the discretion of the Stewards whilst the race is still running. 
            <br>Drivers must enter the pit lane, drive through it complying with the speed limit, and re-join the race without stopping. </p>

          <h2 class="topics2a">ECU</h2>
          <p class="define">Short for Electronic Control Unit, a standard unit that controls the electrical systems on all F1 cars including
            <br> the engine and gearbox. </p>
          <h2 class="topics2a">Energy Store</h2>
          <p class="define">The Energy Store (sometimes abbreviated to ES) is an integral part of an F1 car's powertrain and ERS. Located 
            <br>in the fuel cell and weighing between 20-25kg, the Energy Store usually consists of lithium ion batteries. The Energy Store
            <br> can store (or return to the drivetrain) 4MJ of energy per lap, although MGU-K (see ERS) may only charge the Energy Store 
            <br>with 2MJ per lap. </p>
          <h2 class="topics2a">ERS</h2>
          <p class="define">Energy Recovery Systems, or ERS for short, consist of Motor Generator Units that harness waste heat energy 
            <br>(from the turbocharger) and waste kinetic energy (from the braking system). This energy is then stored and subsequently used
            <br> to propel the car. An F1 car has two ERS: MGU-K (which stands for Motor Generator Unit - Kinetic) and MGU-H (which stands
            <br> for Motor Generator Unit - Heat). These systems are complemented by an Energy Store (ES) and control electronics. ERS is
            <br> capable of providing 120kw of power (approximately 160bhp) for approximately 33 seconds per lap. </p>
          <h2 class="topics2a">Powertrain</h2>
          <p class="define">The term used to describe the entire system providing an F1 car's power. The powertrain (or power unit as it is
            <br> sometimes known) comprises of the engine, two Energy Recovery Systems (ERS) and an Energy Store.</p>
          
            <h2 class="topics2a">Torque</h2>
          <p class="define">Literally, the turning or twisting force of an engine, torque is generally used as a measure of an engine's
            <br> flexibility. An engine may be very powerful, but if it has little torque then that power may only be available over a
            <br> limited rev range, making it of limited use to the driver. An engine with more torque - even if it has less power - may
            <br> actually prove quicker on many tracks, as the power is available over a far wider rev range and hence more accessible.
            <br> Good torque is particularly vital on circuits with a number of mid- to slow-speed turns, where acceleration out of the
            <br> corners is essential to a good lap time. </p>
            
          <h2 class="topics2a">Traction</h2>
          <p class="define">The degree to which a car is able to transfer its power onto the track surface for forward progress. </p>
          
          <h2 class="topics2a">Traction control</h2>
          <p class="define">A computerised system that detects if either of a car's driven (rear) wheels is losing traction - ie spinning 
            <br> and transfers more drive to the wheel with more traction, thus using its more power efficiently. Outlawed from the
            <br> 2008 season onwards. </p>
          
          <h2 class="topics2a">Turbocharger</h2>
          <p class="define">Attached to the engine, a turbocharger uses an exhaust driven turbine to drive a compressor to increase the
            <br> density of the intake air consumed by the engine. Denser air helps an engine create more power for its size. The residual
            <br> heat energy contained in the exhaust gases after expansion in the cylinders of the engine is converted to mechanical
            <br> shaft power by the exhaust turbine. The mechanical power from the turbine is used to drive not only the compressor, but
            <br> also the MGU-H (see ERS). </p>

          <h2 class="topics2a">Blistering</h2>
          <p class="define">The consequence of a tyre, or part of a tyre, overheating. Excess heat can cause rubber to soften and break 
            <br>away in chunks from the body of the tyre. Blistering can be caused by the selection of an inappropriate tyre compound 
            <br>(for example, one that is too soft for circuit conditions), too high tyre pressure, or an improperly set up car.</p>
          <h2 class="topics2a">Degradation</h2>
          <p class="define">A term used to describe the process by which a tyre loses performance or grip. Different from tyre wear which 
            <br>concerns the process by which the tread is worn away.</p>
          
            <h2 class="topics2a">Compound</h2>
          <p class="define">Tread compound is the part of any tyre in contact with the road and therefore one of the major factors in deciding
            <br> tyre performance. The ideal compound is one with maximum grip but which still maintains durability and heat resistance. 
            <br>A typical Formula One race compound will have more than ten ingredients such as rubbers, polymers, sulphur, carbon black, oil and 
            <br>other curatives. Each of these includes a vast number of derivatives any of which can be used to a greater or lesser degree. Very 
            <br>small changes to the mix can change compound performance.</p>
          
            <h2 class="topics2a">Flat spot</h2>
          <p class="define">The term given to the area of a tyre that is worn heavily on one spot after a moment of extreme braking or in the
            <br> course of a spin. This ruins its handling, often causing severe vibration, and may force a driver to pit for a replacement
            <br> set of tyres. </p>
          <h2 class="topics2a">Graining</h2>
          <p class="define">When a car slides, it can cause little bits or rubber ('grains') to break away from the tyre's grooves. These then
            <br> stick to the tread of the tyre, effectively separating the tyre from the track surface very slightly. For the driver, the
            <br> effect is like driving on ball bearings. Careful driving can clear the graining within a few laps, but will obviously have an
            <br> effect on the driver's pace. Driving style, track conditions, car set-up, fuel load and the tyre itself all play a role in
            <br> graining. In essence, the more the tyre moves about on the track surface (ie slides), the more likely graining is. </p>
          
          <h2 class="topics2a">Grip</h2>
          <p class="define">The amount of traction a car has at any given point, affecting how easy it is for the driver to keep control

          <h2 class="topics2a">Heat cycle</h2>
          <p class="define">A term used to describe the process by which a tyre is heated through use and then cooled down. This has the effect of
            <br> slightly changing the properties of the compound and can improve durability. </p>
          
          <h2 class="topics2a">Lock-up</h2>
          <p class="define"> The term used to describe a driver braking sharply and 'locking' one or more tyres whilst the others continue rotating.
            <br> Tyre smoke and flat spots are common side effects.</p>
          
          <h2 class="topics2a">Tyre compound</h2>
